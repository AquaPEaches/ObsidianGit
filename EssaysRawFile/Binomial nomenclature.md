There is no doubt that binomial nomenclature, also named "binary nomenclature" has been a very useful  system for naming species of living things in the field of **taxonomy**(the study of classifying biological organisms into groups based on shared characteristics.)

As the name implies, it is a **two-term naming system** using Latin grammatical forms to create a universal, scientific name to avoid confusion for other researchers that may speak another language to be able to refer to the same organisms. The first section of the name, the *generic name* identifies the **genus** of the species, furthermore, the second part of the name gives the **specific name or specific epithet**
